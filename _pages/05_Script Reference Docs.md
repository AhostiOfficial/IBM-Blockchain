# Script Reference Docs
* * *

## Before you start
Make sure you have followed the instructions in **Prepare & Setup** - they are a prerequisite to any of the install instructions.

## Install with individual commands

Ththis page covers the same ground as the Simple Install and Advanced Install, but rather than using any scripts we will instead individually call a series of commands to ultimately bootstrap a blockchain network, join peers to a channel and launch the Composer playground.  You can then use Composer Playground to create and deploy Business Networks to your blockchain network.

**Why choose this method?**  The Simple Install is the best option for most users - if you've already successfully followed those instructions, you don't need to follow these!  You may wish to follow these instructions if you want to stop part way through the install process e.g. not set up Composer Playground, or fully understand what the scripts are doing,

### 1. Clone this repository
